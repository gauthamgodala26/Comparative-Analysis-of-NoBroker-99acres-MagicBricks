## Project Overview
This repository contains a concise comparative analysis of the free property-listing flows for three major Indian real-estate platforms: **NoBroker**, **99acres**, and **MagicBricks**. The study focuses on how owners create listings, how platforms reduce friction, and where opportunities remain.

---

## Scope of Study
- Platforms analyzed: **NoBroker**, **99acres**, **MagicBricks**  
- Areas evaluated:
  - Onboarding (OTP, email, full signup flows)
  - Property details form (mandatory vs optional fields)
  - Photos & videos (upload UX & quality)
  - Pricing & location (map integration, auto-suggestions)
  - Post-listing leads (dashboard, verification, lead flow)

---

## Analytical Approach
1. Walkthrough of onboarding and sign-up options  
2. Heuristic review of property listing forms for completeness and friction  
3. Media upload UX and quality assessment  
4. Evaluation of pricing/location automation and map accuracy  
5. Post-listing lead capture, visibility and verification checks
